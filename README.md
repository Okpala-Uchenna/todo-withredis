# Flask Todo List Application with Redis

This is a simple Todo list web application built using Flask as the web framework and Redis as the backend data store. The application allows users to perform basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on todo tasks, with Redis storing task data.

```

## Requirements

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Python Libraries

- Flask: Web framework
- Redis: Python client for Redis

## Setup and Run

Follow these steps to get the app running with Redis in Docker containers.

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Okpala-Uchenna/flask-todo.git
cd flask-todo
```

### Step 2: Set Up the Environment

Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine. If not, you can follow the installation guides for [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### Step 3: Build and Run the Containers

To build and run the application using Docker Compose, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will start the Flask application and the Redis service in separate Docker containers.

### Step 4: Access the Application

Once the containers are up and running, open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

You should now see the Todo List application running.

## Jenkins Integration

This project includes a Jenkins pipeline file (`Jenkinsfile`) to automate the process of building and deploying the application with Docker. You can integrate the following pipeline into your Jenkins server to handle continuous integration and deployment.

### Step 1: Set Up Jenkins

1. Install [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/) on your server or use a Jenkins service.
2. Install necessary plugins for Docker and Git in Jenkins (e.g., "Docker Pipeline" plugin).

### Step 2: Create a New Jenkins Pipeline Job

1. Go to Jenkins dashboard and click "New Item".
2. Choose "Pipeline", name it (e.g., "flask-todo"), and click "OK".
3. In the "Pipeline" section, set "Definition" to "Pipeline script from SCM".
4. Select your repository type (Git) and enter the repository URL.
5. Set the "Branch" to the branch where your `Jenkinsfile` is located (usually `main` or `master`).
6. Click "Save" to create the job.

### Step 3: Jenkins Pipeline Steps

The `Jenkinsfile` contains steps to:

1. **Checkout the Code**: Pull the latest code from your repository.
2. **Build the Docker Images**: Build the Flask app and Redis containers using Docker Compose.
3. **Run the Containers**: Deploy the containers in detached mode.
4. **Clean Up**: Optionally, remove the containers after the build process.

### Example `Jenkinsfile`

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        DOCKER_COMPOSE = '/usr/local/bin/docker-compose'  // Update path if needed
    }

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                checkout scm
            }
        }

        stage('Build and Deploy with Docker Compose') {
            steps {
                script {
                    sh 'docker --version'
                    sh 'docker-compose --version'
                    sh 'docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build -d'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Post-Build Cleanup') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker-compose down'
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        success {
            echo "Docker Compose build and deployment succeeded!"
        }
        failure {
            echo "There was an issue with the build or deployment."
        }
        always {
            sh 'docker-compose down'
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Trigger the Build

Once the Jenkins job is set up, you can manually trigger the build or set it to automatically trigger on code changes (e.g., via GitHub webhooks). The Jenkins job will automatically build and deploy the application using Docker.
